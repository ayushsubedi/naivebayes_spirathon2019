| A laptop         | So that you can follow through.                                                                                                                    |
| Git              | If you have a mac or a linux based system, you do not have to worry. Otherwise, please download git. You will be cloning this repo to your system. |
| Jupyter Notebook | So that you can follow through.                                                                                                                    |

## Table of contents:
- **Probability Primer:** We look into some few probability problems and Monte Carlo Simulations to get a basic primer on probability and Python.
- **Probability Primer(Solutions)**: Solutions for the Probability Primer notebook.
- **Conditional Probability**: We look into few examples on conditional probability.
- **Conditional Probability(Solutions)**: Solutions for the Conditional Probability notebook.
- **Bayes Theorem:** We connect Conditional Probability with Bayes Theorem.  We move from what we know to what we can infer and connect the dots.
- **Bayes Theorem(Solutions):** Solutions for Bayes Theorem notebook.
- **Sensitivity, Specificity and Confusion matrix:** We look into concepts of Sensitivity, Specificity, TP, TN, FP and FN. We also look into Type I and Type II errors.
- **Sensitivity, Specificity and Confusion matrix(Solutions):** Solutions for Sensitivity, Specificity and Confusion matrix notebook.
- **Accuracy, Precision and Recall:** We look into different ways to evaluate our models and realize when one is more important than the other. We also study F1 score which combines Precision and Recall.
- **Accuracy, Precision and Recall(Solutions):** Solutions for Accuracy, Precision and Recall notebook.
- **Naive Bayes:** We move from Bayes Theorem to Naive Bayes and define what Naive means.
- **Naive Bayes(Solutions):** Solutions for Naive Bayes
- **NB Spam detection classifier**: We build a binary classifier using Scikit learn and publicly available SMS datasets. We also evaluate our modelâ€™s performance.
- **NB Spam detection classifier(Solutions)**: Solutions for NB Spam detection classifier notebook. 
- **NB vs Bagging, Random Forest and Adaboost(Solutions)**: We will not spend much time here. This notebook basically compares Naive bayes with other algorithmns for the same dataset.
